# Broomrocket for Blender: Open Source Text to 3D Scene

This Blender add-on provides the ability to specify prompts in human language and place meshes in Blender from an asset
library accordingly.

For example:

> Place a house.
> Place a table behind the house.
> Place a vase on the table behind the house.

The add-on supports dummy objects, a local asset library, and Sketchfab as mesh providers. It can be extended to add
more providers.
